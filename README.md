# Browser Window Dimensions Tracker (TBWD)

## Overview

This JavaScript script, "Browser Window Dimensions Tracker," allows you to create a dynamic display of the current browser window's width and height, as well as the height of the document's body. It's a useful tool for web developers and designers who need to monitor how their web pages respond to changes in viewport dimensions.

## Features

- Real-time tracking of the browser window's width and height.

- Responsive design with adjustable styles.

## Usage

2. Customize the script's styles and appearance according to your project's needs.
3. The script will automatically update the displayed dimensions as the browser window is resized.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the script in your HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<!-- Your content goes here -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->

    <!-- Include the script -->
    <script src="window-dimensions-tracker.js"></script>

    <!-- The tracker container will be automatically added to the body -->
</body>
</html>
```
